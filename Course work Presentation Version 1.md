## Quote

It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.

## Introduction

- All Managers face problems in implementing innovation and change.

    But why is this problem persistent? Why is it so difficult for most successful organizations to overcome these problems? Why are the patterns of success - and failures so prevalent across industries?

- To remain successful over a long period of time, managers and organizations must be ambidextrous i.e They must be able to implement both incremental and revolutionary changes.

## Question

- Do you find a juggler who is very good at manupulating a single ball interesting?
- Of course the answer is no… It is only when the juggler can handle multiple balls at one time that his or her skill is respected.

## Definition

Ambidexterity – the use of both hands is not a new concept. The word “ambidextrous” is derived from the Latin roots ambi-, meaning “both,” and dexter, meaning “right” or “favorable.” Thus, “ambidextrous” is literally “both right” or “both favora-ble.” 

Ambidextrous organization is a firm that is:
1. capable of exploiting existing competencies as well as exploring new opportunities with equal dexterity.
1. able to implement both incremental and revolutionary changes.

an Ambidextrous Organization is an organizational development concept coined by R. Duncan (1976) to indicate an organization’s ability to be aligned and efficient in its management of today’s business demands as well as being adaptive to changes in the external environment.Ambidexterity is achieved by balancing exploration (search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, flexibility, discovery or innovation) with exploitation (refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, and execution).

## Types of Organizational ambidexterity
Over the years different types of organizational ambidexterity have appeared.
Sequential ambidexterity Temporal sequence of exploration and exploitation (e.g. one follows the other)
1. Structural ambidexterityLocal or organizational separation of exploration and exploitation (e.g. different business units)
1. Contextual ambidexterityContextual balancing of exploration and exploitation (e.g. simultaneous activities in one organizational unit)
1. Intellectual ambidexterity Cross-over capability or talent of single persons (For further information read the interview with the American neuroscientist Nancy Andreasen at NPR.org)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## Exploitation vs Exploration

### Exploitation

- Refers to the process of permanently improving products and  services to strengthen the company’s competitive position. 
- Never ending request for raising quality standards , increasing efficiency , achieving better and cheaper value proposition
- Sustained renewal based on factual information (e.g. customer feedback and market research ) as well as ideas from within and outside the firm.
- Companies need to improve to remain competitive and not to lag behind and therefore the need for exploitation.
- It is necessary to ensure ongoing improvement of the current business model, elevating current products and services to a higher level of customer satisfaction (sustained/continous renewal).

---

### Exploration

- Refers to the process in which current competitive positions are challenged by introducing new technologies and business models.
- Disruptive innovations do not follow from the facts but need to be invented,  strategists follow imagination ideas not analyzed into existence but need to be generated.
- Creative thinking is necessary , strategists abandon the rules governing sound argumentation.
Dominant logic is challenged.
- It is necessary to create new business models imposing competitors to follow the new rules of the competitive game (disruptive/discontinous renewal).

### Table 1. Comparision between exploitation and exploration



---
## The problem is these two things are very different.
Exploitation is about doing more of the same, only better. Exploration is about doing less of the same and replacing it with new things.
Exploitation is addictive: we know it works, making it better is cheap, and it relies on streamlining and efficiency. Exploration is uncertain, its payoffs are often unknown and risky, and getting there means using resources to experiment and discover new things.

----

## What can managers do?

- Understand the position and priorities of your company.
- Understand the context of your company as the route to ambidexterity is not inherently the same or optimal for each organization.
Analyse what conditions, structures and activities (including rewards and incentives) prioritise either exploitation or exploration in your organization.
Play the long game, not the short game.
Engage scholars: ambidexterity is difficult and messy, but essential.

## What ambidextrity requires of senior managers

1. They must be able to accurately sense changes in their competitive environment.

1. They must be able to act on these opportunities and threats.

---

## Ambidexterity thrives under the following conditions

1. A compelling Strategic intent that intellectually justifies ambidextrous form.
1. Vision and values that promote a common identity but separate cultures.
1. Senior team that explicitly owns the ambidextrous strategy.
1. Separate units with aligned architectures and targeted integration.
1. Ambidextrous Leadership to tolerate and resolve the tensions arising from separate alignments.
