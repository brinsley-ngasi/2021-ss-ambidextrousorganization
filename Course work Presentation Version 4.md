## Exploitation vs Exploration

Exploration                                            | Exploitation                         |
| -------------                                         |:------------------------------------:|
| Unknown needs to be discovered or explored           | Known needs to be exploited                  |
| Risk taking, experimentation, discovery & innovation | refinement, efficiency, selection, implementation & execution |
| learning process involves following a new trajectory | learning process follows an existing trajectory             |
| Returns are less certain and more distant in time    | Returns are more certain and achievable in a shorter time frame       |
