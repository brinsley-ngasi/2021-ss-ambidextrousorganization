## Introduction

- All Managers face problems in implementing innovation and change.

    But why is this problem persistent? Why is it so difficult for most successful organizations to overcome these problems? Why are the patterns of success - and failures so prevalent across industries?

- To remain successful over a long period of time, managers and organizations must be ambidextrous i.e They must be able to implement both incremental and revolutionary changes.

- Sustained renewal based on factual information (e.g. customer feedback and market research ) as well as ideas from within and outside the firm.

### Exploration

- Refers to the process in which current competitive positions are challenged by introducing new technologies and business models.
- Disruptive innovations do not follow from the facts but need to be invented,  strategists follow imagination ideas not analyzed into existence but need to be generated.
- Creative thinking is necessary , strategists abandon the rules governing sound argumentation.
Dominant logic is challenged.
- It is necessary to create new business models imposing competitors to follow the new rules of the competitive game (disruptive/discontinous renewal).
